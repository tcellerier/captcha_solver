# Tensorflow Captcha solver 
Notebook to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of decoding alphanumeric CAPTCHAs of varying lengths and without considering case sensitivity.

* Need a dataset of images (not provided)
* By using CAPTCHAs of 6 or 7 characters, we got the first positive results with a dataset of 3000+ images. Optimal results with 100k+ images.
